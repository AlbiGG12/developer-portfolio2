            <p>Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They’ll hate you for it, but that’s the point of Batman, he can be the
                outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make, the right choice. The world only makes sense
                if
                you force it to.</p>

                you, then you become something else entirely… Legend, Mr. Wayne. I'm not going to kill you. I want you

                do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.</p>

                <p>Whatever you do today, do it with the confidence of a 4 year old in a Batman's Cape. We all wear
                    masks. I
                    wear a mask. And that
                    mask is not to hide who I am but to create what I am. No one cared who I was until I put on the
                    mask.
                    Its not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
